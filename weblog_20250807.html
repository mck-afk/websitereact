            While often being referred to as 'unpaid labour' we don't have to look very far into our economy to see that the vast majority of the activities and responsiblities performed by Mothers are indeed being paid, just simply under circumstances where that labour is 'available to all' as part of the economy (even if that means through privatised business).
            These activities and responsiblities are performed as part of the professions: <a href="https://www.mother.ly/life/the-40-jobs-moms-dothat-we-dont-get-paid-for/">chef, nurse, cleaner, teacher, tutor, chauffeur, life coach, psychologist, psychic, occupational therapist, executive assistant, logistics and event manager, meal planner, personal trainer, translator, and many many more.</a>
            <br><br><i>The activities and responsibilities of Motherwork are financially compensated in our economy, but not in the home, which feeds the economy.</i>
            <br><br>Thus the problem is not with the valuation of the work - no one is arguing about <a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781761260971/">"the most important job in the world"</a> - but rather, the problem lies in the societal structures that surround, view, judge, and ultimately, put a 'value' upon these activities and responsiblities.
            This is the root of our injustice - the way we view Motherwork.

        <h2>Rebranding Motherwork: Step 2</h2>
        <p>
            Remember your Mother. Remember her life-giving gifts that let you be here reading this. 
            <br>Remember that your mother is a model of motherhood and motherwork, and, does not have to be the only one.
        </p>

        <h2>Rebranding Motherwork: Step 3</h2>
        <p>
            Gather inspiration and wisdom. Consult indigenous models of economies outlined in <a href="http://gift-economy.com/recognizing-giving-and-receiving-as-the-maternal-basis-of-language/">The Maternal Gift Economy</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/the-serviceberry-9780241721308">The Serviceberry by Robin Wall Kimmerer 2024</a>.
            <br>Or, use this weird, wacky, wonderful tool and the global power of social media to peek through the windows of other women's lives (while keeping in mind that the algorithm rewards entertainment).
