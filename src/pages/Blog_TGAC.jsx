            <p>An analysis of the anonymous 18th century English poem 'The Goose and the Common' in the context of the digitally interwoven landscape of the 21st century.</p>
            <ul>TLDR:
                <li>The digital commons is much bigger than Big Tech</li>
            </ul>
            the confusion lies in positioning these sources of entertainment as sources of connection. while it be both, the underlying dynamics of the space, the adventising, renders the exchange exploitative rather than mutual.
            <p>as <a href="https://ploum.net/2025-12-15-communication-entertainment.html">Ploum</a> succintly says: 
            "Communication networks are not profitable. Social networks are entertainment platforms, media consumption protocols. Historically, they disguised themselves as communication platforms to attract users and keep them captive."
            Marketing thesmelves are platofmrs for human connection, at a socital point in time where loneliess is a crisis and on the rise, is essentially greenwashing.</p>

                <p>The law locks up the man or woman
                    <br />Who steals the goose from off the common
                    <br />But leaves the greater villain loose

                <p> The law demands that we atone

                <h2>what is a ‘commons’?</h2>
                <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons">Wikipedia</a>, commons are natural resources (air, water, land) that commoners and their communities have rights and access to manage, for both individual and collective benefit. This management process is called commoning.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of our analysis, let’s break down the definition of a commons into a marking rubric, the “Criteria for a Commons”, to aid us in our further analysis:</p>

                <h2>what is a ‘digital commons’?</h2>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons">Wikipedia</a> defines the digital commons, as a collection of shared digital resources (software, knowledge, data, content) that are produced and governed by its community of users and are intended for public use. 

Let’s update our marking rubric to reflect this definition. Using Git we can see our changes highlighted:</p>
                <img src="/images/git.png"/>
                <p>Source: Author, Visual Studio Code, 2025</p>
                <p>Now that we have our “Criteria for a Digital Commons”, we can start to look at examples. That being said, there is one fundamental difference within the first criteria: where the resources come from. In the commons, the resources are produced by mother nature, and while I can use agriculture to adapt the land, I can’t make a flower bloom, or a river run. In the digital commons however, separate from the laws of the natural world like gravity and density, every single aspect of every single resource has been created by human hand. The digital resources I can produce are only limited by my willingness to learn the languages of this digital world.</p>

                <p>Big Tech wants you to believe that they are digital commons—because then, how could they steal it? </p>
                <p>While the technological functions may be aligned with the ideology of digital commons, the business practices of these corporations are fundamentally at odds; such as being <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerbergs-2024-total-compensation-rises">a) designed to funnel profits to leadership,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careless_People"> b) typically governed by dictatorship,</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtqlU_wT-oo">c) turning you into the product.</a> </p>

                <h2>They also get to operate in a legal grey area, benefiting from some laws whilst avoiding others</h2>
                <p>[<a href="https://comm.osu.edu/people/fox.775">Jesse Fox</a>] points out the bizarre double standards in our treatment of online companies verse offline businesses… 

                ‘You can’t say: “Hey I’m a corporation... I manufacture food. You can’t expect me to protect all the people we sell food to, like some of them are gonna get poisoned and die; that’s not on me.”… Their arguments have no validity.’

                - The New Age of Sexism by Laura Bates 2025</p>
                <p>there is the arguement here that because social media and big tech is optional, it is not as critical that its operations are held to these standards of care and harm prevention. However, this is the slippery slope that has led to elections being mainpulated, livestreaming genocide, livestreaming state-sanctioned murder and kidnapping in broad daylight.</p>
                <p>the impact of once tramatising event on the brain, let alone an infinite feed of them.</p>
                <p>And even when they do get fined, the amounts are nominal and they are back in the black within no time (in one case, it took <a href="https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-pays-fines-under-3-weeks">literally 7 seconds</a>).</p>
                <p>Back to our analysis of The Goose and the Common, let’s take a look at geese…</p>
                
                <h2>a goose by any other name</h2>
                <p>In 18th century Europe, when this poem was written, geese were a <a href="https://www.medieval.eu/the-medieval-goose/">part of the peasant economy, typically as a side-activity of a household</a>, because they were easily domesticated due to their ‘imprinting’. Today, I would wage that more of us are familiar with digital representations of geese (‘cyber geese’) than real-world ones; such as the <a href="https://goose.game/">2019 video game: Untitled Goose Game</a> by House House which allows players be a goose and interact with the world and its characters, often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled_Goose_Game">“mischief-making”</a>.</p>
                <p>Humour, and its related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imitating_art">artforms</a>, has been a vehicle to express thoughts or opinions that would otherwise be considered controversial or inappropriate. In Untitled Goose Game, it is humorous to play as a goose stealing, because what is the law to a goose with no ‘personhood’ or claim to private property? Video games <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/gta-6-traffic-incidents-road-services/">simulate real-world scenarios without real-world consequences</a>; and outrunning the law is a part of that, as evidenced by the success of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series.</p>
                <p>In The Goose and the Common, the humour lies in the irony that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal">all men are created equal</a>, yet all men are governed differently—our laws apply differently depending on socioeconomic status, wealth, and proximity to power.</p>
                <h2>what does it all actually mean?</h2>
                <p>I posit that this anlaysis is merely a vehcile for talking about something that is happening on a wider scale.</p>
                <p>The poem begins the implicit statement of fact: ‘it is illegal for us steal’. Which is then immediately juxtaposed by a ‘greater villain’ committing a twofold crime: same crime of stealing, AND also the second crime of avoiding the consequences of the law. The mirrored words of the second and fourth lines in the first stanza highlight the logical fallacy of this inversion: that stealing a goose is a crime, whilst stealing the common is not.</p>
                <p>The Goose and the Common is a powerful piece of art because it starts the story at the initial violence of the oppressor; subverting the mainstream media narrative:</p>
                <p>If the story always begins, not at the initial violence of the oppressor, but at the subsequent revolt of the oppressed, the oppressor is forever the victim, and the oppressed the eternal villain.
