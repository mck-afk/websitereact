            <h2>Most valuable commodity for the next 10 years = Physical Presence</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">age of attention</a> will decay. Digital spaces are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/11/how-grok-nudification-tool-went-viral-x-elon-musk">becoming increasingly hostile</a>, thus we are turning back to the physical world for entertainment, and comfort.</p>
            <p>The servicing of those bodies (temperature, food, water, comfort, transport, entertaining stimuli) will be fruitful endeavours.</p>

            <h2>Career Manifestations: New Job! Community Architects</h2>
            <p>Building off of that, those who support the spaces where bodies can come (moderators, administrators, operations leaders/managers) will be in demand. There may also be a gap in the market for a Community Architect, a specialised consultant who enters a private community space and enhances/amplifies it.</p>
            <p>The most successful/ engaged communities are the ones gathering around <b>Documenting the Journey</b>. In a world where AI can produce any result, the process becomes invaluable.</p>

            <h2>Creation Manifestations: handcrafts & #diditshit</h2>
            <p>A rise in Handcrafts including: Craft workshops/apprenticeships pathways, mending clothes/repurposing fabrics, sculpture/pottery/claywork, Braiding</p>
            <p>#diditshit is a trend of just doing the thing - that at least its better than being AI-generated. Also leaning towards a lifestyle trend - the mindset of prioritising the thing, over my satisfaction with the thing.</p>
            <p>Also part of a broader <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XZ9z6OewR0">Art Renaissance</a>.</p>

            <h2>Health Manifestations: Gym culture, especially weightlifting</h2>
            <p>Athletics wear but heavier/chunkier than the skin tight athleisure. More of the bulkier, thicker, loose fitting. Also bold colours: vibrant reds, royal blues, and jet blacks.</p>
            <h2>Technology Manifestations: Individually, Together</h2>
            <p>A new kind of technology that opens doors to express individuality and connect through those expressions with others. A complete overhaul (or even disavowal) of social media, in favour of building of a new kind of market/exchange network. Some people are already innovating: <a href="https://www.ystrickler.com/start-darkforest/">Dark Forest Theory of the Internet by Yancey Strickler</a> and <a href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe/">32-Bit Cafe</a>. Expect more.</p>
