                        It's acutally quite reflective to think about how did I learn my technological skills? Even though I work in technology, the majority of my peers working in other sectors also have this, seemingly innate technical prowess. 
                        Could this intuitive learning help us be more creative, expansive, and connective? What do we teach our children when we give them a hundred website examples with a hamburger menu in the top right corner - though it is perhaps the design norm,it is not the only way of designing a digital experience.</td>
