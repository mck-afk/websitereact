        <h2>What was it made for?</h2>
        <p>I made The Abode because it's what I wished existed. I wanted a flexible (and colourful!) framework, that incorporated the dimensions of my interests, and had the breadth to house all my creations. I wanted a companion - a home that would live on outside of me - a corner of the internet. 
            <br><br>I use The Abode to:
            <br>1. stimulate exploration of my craft (and myself) through different perspectives (rooms), and
            <br>2. house the fruits of those explorations (my creations) in all their weird and wacky and wonderful forms.
        <br><br>  I wrote more about its purpose in my life in <a href="https://annabelle-grace-mckenzie.com/weblog_20250925">this blog post</a>.
