        <h2 id="1">before words there was cloth</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout history, humans across the globe have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving">weaving</a> to keep their bodies warm and their information secure.
            A weave is made up of two parts: a Warp (longitudinal/vertical) and a Weft (lateral/horizontal).
        </p>

        <p>
            When the weave is complete, the threads become greater than the sum of their parts - cloth. 
            They receive a new name and a new purpose as they transition from collection to composition.
            Certain rituals and beliefs can assist with this transition, such as the <a href="https://www.navajorug.com/pages/deliberate-imperfection-you-bet">Navajo weavers who deliberately incorporate imperfections to honor the Gods, and in particular their teacher, Spiderwoman.</a>

        </p>

        <h2>to compose a computer</h2>
        <p>
            In 1804 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine">Jacquard Loom</a> was patented as an automated weaving solution, featuring punch cards that could produce repeatable patterns and sequences.
            Each <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6yL0_sDnX0">hole in the punch card</a> allowed the pin to pass through, lifting the warp thread so that the weft can pass underneath, as per the pattern.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1822, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">"using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom",</a> Charles Babbage invented a machine that could perform calculations called the Difference Engine. 
            The basic architecture was similar to that of a modern computer, in that it was a composition of on or off switches (1 or 0 respectively).
            <br>
            During 1842-1843, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace became the first computer programmer</a>, writing an algorithm for another one of Charles's machines, the Analytical Engine.
            <br>
            Despite these innovations, the machines were not reproducible, so human computation was still best practice for the next century or so, even powering humankind's first visit to the moon in the 1960's.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">By 1943, most human computers were women.</a>
                <br><br>The following dialogue from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/quotes/">Hidden Figures (2016)</a> highlights the short-hand:
                <br><br>
                "what's the status of that computer?"
                <br>"<i>she's</i> right behind you..."

            The 1970's fostered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">personal computer era</a>, lowering the barriers to entry for more and more people to bring their ideas to life.<br>
            Once such innovation occured in 1990's when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web</a> with "the original idea... was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information".
            <br>And what such rules for the sharing of information will there be?
        </p>

        <h2 id="2">the rules of word-weaving</h2>
        <p>
            As our current scientific knowledge stands, what separates human languages from the languages of our mammal cousins is the structures of abstraction which enable us to communicate <a href="https://jeremylent.wordpress.com/2010/08/23/language-weaving-a-net-of-symbols/">counterfactual</a> information.
            <br><br>
            One of the simplest ways we can do this is through the structure of our sentences - the positioning of the words, within the weave of the sentence.
            <br><br>
            For example:
            "Imagine an apple. It is red."<br>
            Here we are communicating counterfactual information; this 'red apple' really only exists in the mind of the reader.
            <br><br>
            But then:
            "Imagine a purple..." <br>
            In that space where we have some information but not all of what we were expecting, we are in a liminal space where it cna be everything and nothing at once.
            <br>This is what the internet feels like to me, and is what I mean when I say:
        </p>
        <h2>we are suspended in the weave</h2>

        <p>
            The internet is a self-referential web of relationally defined information. While many things in our languages tie back to some piece of factual information (the apple, the colour purple), the internet opens the opportunity to use its self-referential features to create information ABOUT the information - also known as metadata. 
            <br>There is an infinite amount of information we can add to a piece of information to add context, since the internet does not come with certain parameters that might be assumed in the physical world such as gravity or density.
            And because we don't need to take a breath between sentences, we could ignore sentence syntax and simply keep adding an infinite amount of "and's" onto a sentence and hope that it makes sense.
       </p>

        <blockquote class="note red">
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                <br>"a piece of information <br><br>is really defined only by<br><br> what it's related to,<br><br> and how it's related."
            </p>

            Like this blog for example. The sum of parts might seem messy to some and coherent to others. Maybe I've hidden syntactical rebellions to further demonstrate my points. Actually, it's not a 'maybe' - it's a 'definitely and deliberately'.
            <br> Just like the threads, each and every word, each and every sentence, each and every break, each and every link - all contribute to the composition of this piece and its place in the internet.
